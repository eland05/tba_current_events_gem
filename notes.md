1. Plan your gem
2. Start with project structure - google
3. Start with entry point
4. Force that to build the CLI Interface
5. stub out the interface
6. start making things real
7. discover objects
8. programs


1. User types Current Blue Alliance Events
2. get CLI working with fake data (list current events)
3. Which event?
4. Event website, webcast, teams


What is an event?
  An event has a name
  An event has a date
  An event has a location
  An event has a site

Issues to fix:
1. Why happens if there are more or less than 5 events?
2. Where did the extra 0 come from in my when @events is created?
